This project is an implementation of the genetic programming control structure described by John Koza in his book "Genetic Programming; on the programming of computers by means of natural selection." Most of the book can be viewed at http://books.google.com/books?id=Bhtxo60BV0EC

We wish to use this implementation to solve difficult problems in artificial intelligence.

To run an example simply chose an example from the examples diretory.
