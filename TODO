the Genetic controller class is very young. It could use a lot of cleaning up

the method build_initial_structures is currently not exactly the way Koza describes on page 93

Koza describes testing for different fitness cases. the test_organism method might later pass fitness cases to test_fitness_case

Need to have a better interface to examine what is going on. The display_fitness_curves is a start. I dream of a program that displays a changing 2d hisogram of the current generation and lets you change parameters for next generation.
